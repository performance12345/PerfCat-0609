        qThread provides an simplified and safe way to stop long running 
        threads.  Typical uses often look like this::
        
            # Test / Usage of the stoppable thread
            class MyThreadingClass(StoppableThread):
                def __init__(self, a):
                    super(MyThreadingClass, self).__init__()
                    self.a = a
                    self.b = "World"
                    self.delay = .5 # seconds
                    
                def startup(self):
                    # Overload the startup function
                    print "My Thread Starting Up..."
                    
                def cleanup(self):
                    # Overload the cleanup function
                    print "My Thread Is Shutting Down..."
                    # Close files, ports, etc...
                    time.sleep(4)
                    print "Cleanup Complete!"
                    
                def mainloop(self):
                    # Some routine to be called over and over
                    # ie: reading ports or sockets
                    print self.a + " " + self.b
        
                    # Throttling needs to be done here if the
                    # primary function is not blocking
                    time.sleep(self.delay)
